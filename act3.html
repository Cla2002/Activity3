                    <p>Use any cut of pork that you prefer. I suggest pork belly for best results. However, use leaner parts if you are trying to avoid fats. 
                        <br> Pork tenderloin is a healthier choice. This is very tender and contains way less fat than pork belly. You can also use other 
                        <br>proteins such as chicken and goat meat using this recipe.</p>
